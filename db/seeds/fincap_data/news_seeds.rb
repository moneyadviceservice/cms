The way in which payments are made in the UK is set to undergo the most radical
change since the 1960s. This follows the [launch of a new strategy](https://www.paymentsforum.uk/final-strategy) to give people
greater control over how they manage their day-to-day finances and help stamp
out financial fraud.
In the first industry-wide initiative of its kind, the Payments Strategy Forum,
whose members include consumer groups, businesses, fintechs, UK banks and
building societies, today recommends a new way of making payments that promises
greater protection and security for consumers and businesses.(2)
The Strategy gives:
*   More control and assurance for consumers over how they manage their finances
*   Safer and more secure banking
*   Opportunities for new banks and Fintechs to compete and offer innovative services that meet the needs of tomorrowâ€™s users
